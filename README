1) Prepare indexing: makebib.pl
	- create list mapping identifiers to filenames
	- ignore list: should the filename column be empty?
	- deletion list: should this be created by comparing the 
	  previous indexing list?  Somewhat dangerous -- it's probably
	  better to simply say we'll remove anything which is not in
	  the list
   indexing list is naturally sorted case insensitively

2) tokenization: tokenizer.pl
	all input/output is based on accno identifiers
   All files controlling indexing should be copied to a configuration
   directory local to the indexing process, and then:
	tokenizer.pl --configdir DIR author xauthor affiliation object object_LPI object_IAU keyword title text


3) file inversion
